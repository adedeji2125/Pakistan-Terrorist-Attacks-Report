# PAKISTAN TERRORIST ATTACKS REPORT
# Problem Statement:
This dashboard provides ananalysis of terrorist attacks in Pakistan, examining key trends, regional patterns, and the impact. It highlights the frequency and severity of attacks over time, identifies hotspots, and explores the socio-political and economic factors driving terrorism.
# Tool Used:
1. MS Excel (Power Query)- Data Cleaning and Transformation.
2. Power BI- Dashboards  Creation and Visualization.

# Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA):
  The EDA on the Pakistan Terrorist Attack dataset begins with data cleaningâ€”addressing missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates to ensure accuracy. Afterward, univariate and bivariate analyses explore the distribution of attack types, weapon usage, and affected locations, identifying which categories are most frequent or severe.

# Analysis Steps:
1. I imported the dataset, originally saved as a CSV file, into Power Query using Microsoft Excel for data Cleaning and transformation.
2. Two separate CSV files, each containing approximately 450 rows and 27 columns, were imported into Power Query. The files were then appended to create a single, unified dataset with 900 rows and 27 columns.
3. I extracted the day, month, and year of each attack into separate columns to facilitate more detailed date-based analysis.
4. "I filled missing values in the quantitative column with 0 and in the categorical column with 'Nill' to maintain data completeness and consistency for analysis.
5. Following data cleaning, I applied the changes, saved the dataset, and imported it into Power BI for visualization and in-depth analysis.
6. In Power BI, I created visualizations to extract and highlight meaningful insights from the data, displaying key information on cards for clarity and emphasis."
